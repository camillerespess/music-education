<h1>Music Increases Motor Control</h1>
  <div id="motortext">
    <p> Interacting with music, whether making it or listening, has positive effects on motor control. Hearing music and dancing to it is not only enjoyable for toddlers and adults alike, it’s also a way to sharpen motor function. What’s more, playing and studying instruments only increases motor function skills.</p>

<h1>Music Creates Bonds</h1>
  <div id="bondstext">
    <p>Music creates community and a sense of belonging, so relationships can certainly be built or strengthened with it. Bedtime songs, as detailed in <a href="https://www.carnegiehall.org/Blog/2016/01/Why-Making-Music-Matters-Music-and-Early-Childhood-Development"> a 2016 Carnegie Hall report</a>, are an example of this. “When caregivers sing lullabies, they use pitch, rhythm, and lyrics to soothe, teach language, communicate hope and affection, and provide security as a child goes from wakefulness to sleep, or light to dark.”</p>

    <p>As a form of communication itself, music <a href="https://www.carnegiehall.org/Blog/2016/01/Why-Making-Music-Matters-Music-and-Early-Childhood-Development"> serves as a way </a> for children to process routines, understand structure, and cooperate. Music also <a href="https://www.pbs.org/parents/thrive/the-benefits-of-music-education"> strengthens verbal skills </a> and can serve as a way to provide structure to social interactions. Listening to music in a foreign language is a method to strengthen a child’s communication and language skills, while also creating inclusive environments for students of varying backgrounds.</p>

<h1> Music Education Supports All Learning</h1>
  <div id="learningtext">
    <p> According to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/parents/thrive/the-benefits-of-music-education"> PBS Kids </a>, an education in music helps children in other areas as well. Practicing music requires engagement with the brain, ears, eyes, and muscles. The skills developed in those areas of the body can be used in and out of music. In educational settings, music can be used to set a tune to information, like the alphabet.</p>
